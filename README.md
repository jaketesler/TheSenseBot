**Note: The contents of the library submodules <br>
must be placed in the Arduino 'libraries' folder (inside your sketch folder) for <br>
the program to function properly. For more info, [see here](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries)**
Because the entire repo isn't required, only certain folders must be copied.
<br>They are as follows: (repo @ commit /directory/to/move --> move\_to\_here)

*	[arduino\_libraries @ commit] /Time --> libraries folder	
*	[arduino\_libraries @ commit] /DS1307RTC --> libraries folder	
*	[arduino\_libraries @ commit] /SendOnlySoftwareSerial --> libraries folder	
*	[MPL3115A2_Breakout @ commit] /library/MPL3115A2\_Pressure --> [move folder to libraries folder, rename to MPL3115A2]
*	[lsm303-arduino @ commit] /LSM303 --> libraries folder
*	[tweetpot @ commit] /arduino/HIH4030 --> libraries folder
*	[libraries] /Adafruit\_Sensor --> libraries folder
*	[libraries] /Adafruit\_TSL2561 --> libraries folder
